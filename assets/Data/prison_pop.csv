"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held or length of sentence. Federal data include prisoners held in nonsecure, privately operated community corrections facilities and juveniles held in contract facilities. Estimates provided by state and federal departments of corrections’ administrative record systems, and may not reflect prisoners’ self-identification of race or Hispanic origin. State, federal, and national totals by race and Hispanic origin will differ from other tables in this report due to adjustments made by BJS to correct for differences between administrative records and prisoner self-report of racial and ethnic identity.",,,,,,,,,,,
